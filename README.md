# Designing Art Gallery using Dynamic Segments with useParams in React Router

**On a traditional website, when a user clicks on a URL, the browser makes a full-page request from the server and directs the user to a new page. This is referred to as static routing.**

This is very useful if you need to navigate the user to a new page. But with the development of web apps, there's more need for pages to render on the client or load dynamically.

This involves updating particular parts of the URL called segments, as well as rendering new content or updating the content on the same page without making a request from the server or reloading the entire page.

This is very common and useful in modern web apps. It enables client-side rendering, improves webiste navigation, and enables smooth transitions and animations (since the browser doesn't need to reload the page from external servers).

This can overall improve website performance and enable a good user experience.
